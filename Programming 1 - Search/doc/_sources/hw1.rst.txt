Programming 1 - Search
=================================

Welcome to Programming assignment 1 for CSE 471 - Fall 2021.

This document contains several instructions to help you with the running
and submitting the assignment.

=================================
Setting up the **hw1** Directory
=================================

#. We assume that you have completed the setup as instructed using the Virtual Machine provided for Homework 1 on Gradescope. The provided virtual machine already contains the "hw1" directory in ~/catkin_ws/src/. 

#. If you need to access the "hw1" directory separately, you can also download the "hw1.zip" file from Gradescope and unzip it.
   Copy the "hw1" folder that was unzipped to `~/catkin_ws/src/`.

	.. code-block:: bash

	   cp -r <download_path>/hw1/ ~/catkin_ws/src/

#. Change the permission of all Python scripts to make them executable.

	.. code-block:: bash

	   chmod u+x ~/catkin_ws/src/hw1/scripts/*.py

#. Run catkin_make from your catkin workspace.

	.. code-block:: bash

	   cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make

#. Source `setup.bash`.

	.. code-block:: bash

		source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

#. Set up the environments.

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd ~/catkin_ws/src/hw1/ && ./env_setup.sh

#. Useful tip you can use throughtout the assignment: 
   If you ever run into issues and need to kill the running gazebo or roscore processes, run the following command. 
   You can also use this command when the gazebo opens up but the turtlebot doesn't move.

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd ~/catkin_ws/src/hw1/ && ./hw1_kill.sh

========================
Environment Description
========================



**Environment 1 - Can World**

The image below shows an example of the can environment that the turtlebot3 robot operates in.
The goal is the red can; all other cans are obstacles that need to be avoided.

.. figure:: ./images/can.png
		:scale: 100 %
		:alt: A sample can world

**Environment 2 - Cafe World**

The image below shows an example of the cafe environment that the turtlebot3 robot operates in.
The goal is the food placed on the kitchen counter; all the tables are obstacles that need to be avoided.

.. figure:: ./images/cafe.png
		:scale: 100 %
		:alt: A sample cafe world


Some of the terms that we use throughout the programming assignment for both the environments are:

#. Grid Dimensions: Size of the square grid.
	.. note ::
		Actual grid size used for navigation is different from what is seen in Gazebo environment. Each of the square seen in Gazebo is divided into 4 equal squares. 

		.. list-table::
			:header-rows: 0

			* - .. figure:: ./images/grid.png

			      Fig 1. Grid visible in Gazebo

			  - .. figure:: ./images/grid_actual.png

			      Fig 2. Actual navigation grid

		Hence, if you have to go from point A to B in Gazebo environment using 'MoveF' action, you will have to give 'MoveF' command twice. If you give the 'MoveF' command once, the TurtleBot will stop at T.

#. Goal: A can of red color (for Can World), and food on the kitchen counter (for Cafe World).
#. Obstacles: Smaller cans obstructing the TurtleBot's path in Can World, and tables obstructing the TurtleBot's path in Cafe World.
#. Actions: Actions includes {MoveF, TurnCW, TurnCCW}. Move actions move the turtlebot forward along an edge, and Turn actions rotate it clockwise or counterclockwise.
    * Cost of the MoveF action is 1.
    * Cost of the TurnCW and TurnCCW actions is 2.
#. State:  State of the turtlebot represented as (x, y, :math:`\phi`) where x and y are coordinates, :math:`\phi` is an orientation in {NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST}.

===============================
Implementing Search Algorithms
===============================

* Modify the `compute_g()` and `compute_h()` methods in the `evaluate.py` file. We have provided a basic template where you should write your code.
* Do not modify any other file. Make all the changes you need strictly in `evaluate.py` file only. 
* You can use visual studio code, pycharm, sublime, gedit, or any other editor that you're comfortable with to implement.
* Unless otherwise specified, use the Manhattan heuristic whenever you need to return a heuristic value.
* Modifying evaluate.py 
    * Do not modify the function signature of existing methods.
	* Remove the `raise NotImplementedError` code block and replace it with the code to the compute the g-value or h-value and return this value.
	* The returned value must be a positive integer or 0.
* Both `compute_g()` and `compute_h()` have 3 parameters passed to them.
    * algorithm - A string that represents which algorithm is running. This is passed as a command line argument to the program.
        The required algorithms you need to handle are:
            #. bfs - Breadth First Search
            #. ucs - Uniform Cost Search
            #. gbfs - Greedy **Best** First Search
            #. astar - A* Search
            #. custom-astar - (Extra credit) A* with a custom heuristic.
    * node - A Node (`node.py`) object that is being evaluated in the search 
        tree. Note that each node has all its fields already initialized prior
        to calling these functions. More information about the Node class can
        be found in the API located at the end of this document..
    * goal_state - A State (`problem.py`) object that represents the goal state.
        More information about the State class can be found in the API located
        at the end of this document.

============================
Testing your Implementation
============================

**Follow these steps to locally test your implementation.**

Fill in the necessary blocks in `evaluate.py` by removing the `raise NotImplementedError` and replacing it with your code.
If you choose not to implement an algorithm (for example the extra credit work) simply leave the statement unchanged in
both `compute_g()` and `compute_h()` for that algorithm.

Once done, you need to execute `rosrun hw1 search.py` with the appropriate algorithm and the environment.
For example, If you implemented `compute_g()` and `compute_h()` for "bfs" and "cafeWorld" environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    rosrun hw1 search.py --algorithm bfs --env cafeWorld

This will also post plenty of output to your console giving you some valuable information about your implementation including
any errors that were encountered. If the error field is None then that means that your implementation ran without issues.

.. code-block:: bash

    ==========================
    Dimension..........: 5
    Obstacles..........: 0
    Seed...............: 1599124437
    Environment........: cafeWorld
    Algorithm..........: bfs
    Error..............: NotImplementedError
    Time Taken.........: 0.01
    Nodes expanded.....: 0
    Plan Length........: 0
    Plan...............: []


In the code block above, the Error output is not None. This means that there were errors encountered and you would need to debug
the implementation. You can modify any file to debug your code, however, your final test code should only modify `evaluate.py` and
leave all the other files untouched.
   
search.py
==========
`search.py` contains several options that you can specify to change the world
generated so that you can test different worlds.

.. code-block:: bash

    rosrun hw1 search.py -h

    usage: search.py [-h] [--dimension DIMENSION] [--obstacles OBSTACLES]
                 [--seed SEED]
                 [--algorithm {all,bfs,ucs,gbfs,astar,custom-astar}]
                 [--submit] [--output-file OUTPUT_FILE] [--env ENV]

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --dimension DIMENSION
                            The dimension 'nxn' of the n x n grid.
    --obstacles OBSTACLES
                            The number of obstacles in the grid.
    --seed SEED           The random seed
    --algorithm {all,bfs,ucs,gbfs,astar,custom-astar}
                            The algorithm to run
    --submit              Run the experiments required for submission
    --output-file OUTPUT_FILE
                            Store the output in the specified file
    --env ENV             Choose environment b/w cafeWorld and canWorld

For example to generate a "canWorld" with a dimension of 5x5 and 2 obstacles and test
with the "ucs" algorithm, enter the following in the terminal.

.. code-block:: bash

    rosrun hw1 search.py --dimension 5x5 --obstacles 2 --algorithm ucs --env canWorld
    
The output contains all data to reproduce the results. You can use "all" for
algorithms to run all algorithms.

=================================
Checking Execution on Turtlebot3
=================================

Once you have an implementation working, you can run the found solution on
Gazebo. To do this, you need to provide an additional argument that instructs `search.py`
to save the results to an output file. Refer the command below and use it for appropriate dimensions, obstacles, algorithm, and environment.

.. code-block:: bash

    rosrun hw1 search.py --output-file /tmp/test.csv
    
The above command will run the default algorithm (all) along with the default
dimension, obstacles and seed for the world and store the output in
`/tmp/test.csv`. You can open this file in software like Excel or a simple
text editor like Notepad++.

To run Gazebo, execute

.. code-block:: bash
    
    rosrun hw1 gazebo.py --input-file /tmp/test.csv
    
This will open Gazebo and run each solution in the specified file.

If you only want to run a single solution in the specified file (will run faster), you can pick
which solution to execute by specifying the line number that the solution
occurs in the solution file (lines are numbered starting with 1).

.. code-block:: bash

    rosrun hw1 gazebo.py --input-file /tmp/test.csv --line 3
    
This will run the solution occuring at line 3 (provided the file has 3 lines)
and will exit after that.

==================================================
Preparing your Submission to Submit to Gradescope
==================================================

1. When you have finished implementing all the algorithms you need to use the submit
mode of `search.py`. It'll work for either/both environments you tried.

**Run the following command to ready the submission files:**

.. code-block:: bash

    rosrun hw1 search.py --submit
    
This will run 100 different world combinations and each one of them will be run
with a time limit of 5 mins (300 seconds). A file called `hw1_results.csv` will
be created in the `~/catkin_ws/src/hw1/scripts/` directory which will contain
results of the run. **HINT**: Make sure that there are no TimeoutErrors in the
results. If there are, then its likely your implementation is incorrect. 

.. warning::

    The submission runs several tests so make sure you run this command plenty
    of time before the submission deadline.

.. note:: 

    Submit mode will not produce Debug output. Instead `hw1_results.csv`
    will contain the Debug output in a .csv format. 

Execute the following to ensure that the `hw1_results.csv` file was created.

.. code-block:: bash

    ls ~/catkin_ws/src/hw1/scripts/
    /home/cse471/catkin_ws/src/hw1/scripts/hw1_results.csv

2. The next step is to create the plots. You can open the `hw1_results.csv` in
software like Excel or write your own code to process the file and generate the
required plots (see the assignment question on the description of what needs
to be plotted).

Please store the plots in the same directory (`~/catkin_ws/src/hw1/scripts/`).
Name the plot files as `task2.png` and `task3.png` for Tasks 2 and 3 
respectively. While we do allow other file extensions, .png is the recommended
format in which we prefer the plots.

Submitting Your Homework
=========================

You now need to simply zip the `~/catkin_ws/src/hw1/` directory and upload it
to Gradescope. The zip file should be named as <first name>_<asu_id>_hw1.zip.
Upload your zip file on gradescope under Q1.5.

.. warning:: 

    Please make sure that the zipped file contains hw1_results.csv, task1.png
    and task2.png. Also make sure that you have not renamed any file that was
    originally provided. 
    
    Do not create any new files since there will be no
    way for the autograder to know that it has to copy them over.

=====================
Tips and Suggestions
=====================

#. The API section below contains all getter and setter functions required to complete this assignment.
#. Test your algorithm with smaller grid or smaller number of obstacles to see if it works as expected.
#. Since the obstacles and mazes are generated dynamically, sometimes it is possible that there is no path from initial state to goal state. If your algorithm returned empty action_list, check once if there is path from initial state to goal state.
#. You need not start a new run to record running time if there is no path between initial state and goal state. The time taken for this case should also be considered while taking average of 5 runs.
#. At times, the TurtleBot takes some time to perform an action, so wait for some time if no movement is visible.
#. Check the slack channels to see if the problem you are facing is already answered. If not, start a new discussion.

Hints for Designing the Extra Credit Heuristic
===============================================
In the section **Environment Description**, you will find that action costs are
different for different actions. Question 1 of the homework provides a hint
that you can use in designing the heuristic.

Remember the cost trade-off. Your heuristic must not be too expensive to compute.
One extreme case is to run Breadth FS from a state and return the plan length from
that state as the heuristic value. This gives you a very good estimate, since
you run Breadth FS internally however the time to compute a single state's
heuristic value is quite large which makes it effectively useless since we could
have just done a Breadth FS anyways. Doing BFS or any other of the implemented
algorithms as the extra credit heuristic won't get you extra credit!
